## Kotlin Extended Library

The missing standard library functions for Kotlin.

## Code Example

TODO multi let example?

TODO zip example?

TODO maybe example?

## Motivation

Kotlin makes coding fun. What isn't fun is spending a lot of time making
very basic functions to fill in the gaps where the kotlin std lib is
missing. Instead, you should just get to write code.

## Installation

TODO: Publish to jcenter

## Contributors
